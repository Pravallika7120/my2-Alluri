###### My favourite vacation spot is NANDI HILLS in Bangalore

  Nandi Hills is situated 60km north to Banglore,karnataka state,India. **The place-name Anandagiri (Hill of Pleasure) was changed into Nandagirihill of Nandi**.  And my personal experience is drive all the way Nandi Hills and sight of the **SUN RISE**. Then it is a best place to visit in the time of september to january for expereincing the best road trip with full of FOG.<br>
